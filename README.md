<h1>StarryB</h1>

  <p>This Java program generates the letter "B" using stars (*) and displays it on the console. The letter "B" is created using a 2D character array and specific conditions to determine the placement of stars.</p>

  <h2>How it Works</h2>

  <p>The program utilizes a 2D character array to represent the letter "B" with stars and spaces. The stars are assigned based on the following conditions:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The leftmost and rightmost columns are filled with stars.</li>
    <li>The middle row is filled with stars, excluding the last two columns.</li>
    <li>The top row is filled with stars, excluding the last two columns.</li>
    <li>The bottom row is filled with stars, excluding the last two columns.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>All other positions in the array are filled with spaces.</p>
